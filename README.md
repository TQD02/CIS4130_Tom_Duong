An interest in games lies in many of us, including myself, but only few have found significance in the data behind those games. I grew up playing the game Clash Royale, and seeing a big dataset from the top players sparked a fire in me. From Clash Royale Wiki, the game is “the fast-paced brawler where you collect cards and duel players in real time. Destroy your opponent's Crown Towers, but be sure to defend your own.” Each match includes 2 players, each possessing a deck of 8 character cards they can deploy for a certain amount of elixir.

The dataset that I would be using could be assessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/s1m0n38/clash-royale-games/data

The dataset in question is statistics from matches of top players from September 2022 to December 2023 Each month represents one season of the game which adds up to 15 seasons of game data. This data set contains 23 columns which includes: information of when the match took place and game mode. It also contains information regarding 2 players  in each match (11 columns each): their unique ids, trophies before the match, the number of crowns left and their 8 specific cards on their deck. I intend on predicting the number of crowns left in matches based on the average elixir cost of each player’s deck using a supervised learning model.

This project look at the data of top Clash Royale players in order to build a prediction model for the number 
of crowns that players might obtain given the units they have equipped
